# Questions to Ask Mike

1. What is the end/goal for the semester, besides the multiple in-progress reviews (IPR's). i.e: a prototype, models, etc.
2. What is a good schedule/system for the IPR's. Are there certain days that work for your team or how/when should we meet. Zoom? In Person?
3. What items will be supplied by you/ who is paying for computer equipment and devices to create a working badge? I understand each badges needs to cost less than $50 but the items supplied does not list anything? Do we have free range on what to implement?

## Refresher on Capabilities

### Required Features

#### An Operating System
* Ask what they "mean" by an OS?

	* an RTOS?
	* firmware controlling software? 
	* Arduino SDK?

* Why do they require an OS, and what do they need from it?
	* desired functionality from OS

#### Point-to-Point (p2p) Networking
* What are some of the ideal functions for the short‐range/regular wireless point‐to‐point networking? So we know the use-cases to design for
* What networking features do they require?
	* Preferred wired protocol?
	* Functionalities desired from P2P networking?
	* Does it need to interface with other devices on the same LAN/WLAN when connected to a host?

#### On/Off/PC interface switch
* What do you mean by "PC" interface?
	* What functionality should it provide? Should the device act as a storage drive in tandem with p2p networking? (i.e. able to access it's files from a local machine?)

#### 21 Hours of Battery
* 21 hours of active or passive use?
	* tolerance on this?

#### USB-C interface
* USB-c for charging AND data?

#### Maximum Dimensions -- 4w, 4l 1d
* Tolerance on this?
#### Mass not to exceed 150g
* Tolerance on this too?
#### Landyard attachment point
* No questions
#### Visible VETCON branding/miltech decor
* Could you explain specific requirements for the branding/ logo and colors on the badge? What font and text would you like and approximately where should it be on the badge and how much space is it taking up?

### Desired/Additional

#### 320x240 Pixel Display
* What type of display preferred? Does it need to be HFR?
	* Will implement if tradeoff regarding battery life can be agreed upon
#### Short-range wireless point-to-point
* What type of protocols were you thinking of?
	* Bluetooth?
#### Wireless mesh networking

#### Configurable LED lights
* Individually Addressable?
#### Optional User Addon Accessories
* Anything you had in mind?
* Would the optional user add‐on accessories be some that we also design, or would the badge have to support any made by the user?
#### Puzzle game for acheivements
* Scope/complexity of puzzle game given constraints?
#### Audio speaker with frequency response 50hz to 15 kHz
